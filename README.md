## sdAbs Framework Conservation Analysis

This repository contains the code and Jupyter notebooks used to analyze framework region (FR) conservation and entropy across nanobody sequences from multiple public databases.
The goal of this project is to compare the conservation of framework regions among Camelid species (e.g., Lama glama, Vicugna pacos, Camelus bactrianus, Camelus dromedarius) and explore sequence variability patterns.

## Data sources

All sdAbs sequences used in this project were obtained from publicly available repositories.
